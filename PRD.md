Use Flutter to build a macos app which listens on `Alt+K` hot key globally. When the hot key is pressed, it starts audio recording. When the hot key is pressed again, it stops the audio recording, and then save the recorded audio to a app specific temp dir. It uses the speech-to-text API from OpenAI (whisper-1 api) to transcribe the recorded audio. It inserts the transcribed text into the current cursor location whichever app the user is using, such as Notes app.
